# Pinescript-Trading-Strategy
A compilation of trading indicators written in pinescript.

The script plots VWAPs (volume weighted average price) that are anchored at the start of every day, week, month, and year, as well as rolling 7-day and 30-day VWAPs. 
It also records the VWAP of the previous day/week/month/year. 
Combined with simple moving averages, the script overall has been useful to me in a mean reversion and momentum based trading strategy.
